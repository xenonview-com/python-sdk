# Development Environment

## Dependencies

* docker

## Running tests

You can run the tests for the whole project in the root directory by simply running:

```bash
./ant test
```
Note: you can run only a specific test by:  

```-Dtest=test_name```

##The following sections show how to run testing variants during development.

### Coverage

To run the tests in "coverage mode" (runs all tests then calculates coverage for each dir/file):
```bash
./ant coverage
```

# Publishing

_We (package maintainers) handle this step so this is more of internal notes:_

To publish the package (we standard pip packaging eg. setup.py and have scripts to automate):

```shell
./bump
./deploy deploy-prod
```
Note: you can also deploy-test to send to staging env.
